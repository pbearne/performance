Prioritizes the loading of images and videos based on how visible they are to actual visitors; adds fetchpriority and applies lazy-loading.

== Description ==

This plugin optimizes the loading of images (and videos) with prioritization, lazy loading, and more accurate image size selection.

The current optimizations include:

1. Ensure `fetchpriority=high` is only added to an `IMG` when it is the Largest Contentful Paint (LCP) element across all responsive breakpoints.
2. Add breakpoint-specific `fetchpriority=high` preload links for the LCP elements which are `IMG` elements or elements with a CSS `background-image` inline style.
3. Apply lazy-loading to `IMG` tags based on whether they appear in any breakpoint’s initial viewport. (Additionally, [`sizes=auto`](https://make.wordpress.org/core/2024/10/18/auto-sizes-for-lazy-loaded-images-in-wordpress-6-7/) is then also correctly applied.)
4. Implement lazy-loading of CSS background images added via inline `style` attributes.
5. Add `fetchpriority=low` to `IMG` tags which appear in the initial viewport but are not visible, such as when they are subsequent carousel slides.
6. Reduce the size of the `poster` image of a `VIDEO` from full size to the size appropriate for the maximum width of the video (on desktop).
7. Lazy-load `VIDEO` tags by setting the appropriate attributes based on whether they appear in the initial viewport. If a `VIDEO` is the LCP element, it gets `preload=auto`; if it is in an initial viewport, the `preload=metadata` default is left; if it is not in an initial viewport, it gets `preload=none`. Lazy-loaded videos also get initial `preload`, `autoplay`, and `poster` attributes restored when the `VIDEO` is going to enter the viewport.

**This plugin requires the [Optimization Detective](https://wordpress.org/plugins/optimization-detective/) plugin as a dependency.** Please refer to that plugin for additional background on how this plugin works as well as additional developer options.

👉 **Note:** This plugin optimizes pages for actual visitors, and it depends on visitors to optimize pages. As such, you won't see optimizations applied immediately after activating the plugin. Please wait for URL Metrics to be gathered for both mobile and desktop visits. And since administrator users are not normal visitors typically, optimizations are not applied for admins by default.

There are currently **no settings** and no user interface for this plugin since it is designed to work without any configuration.
